Please read LICENSE.txt too! (its kinda important)

===NOTICE===
you MUST provide credit to myself as the original code author wherever you share/display the project. - However you cannot use my name or associate names (Eren Can't) to promote your version of the project.
You SHOULD NOT try to recreate the same or similar kinds of content on YT as myself using this project - UNLESS the content you create doesn't have a resemblance to the content I am making - For example: different sprites and added features

====How to Use====
You will notice the project contains empty rule tiles. The rules exist and I have kept 
them defined, however due to copyright I cannot include the sprites from Terraria. Instead the project does include screenshots (In the /RuleTileSetup folder) as to how you can setup the rule tiles, just not the sprites themselves. - Although there is a link below where you can find all the sprites.

Welcome to the Terraria Project! It has lighting, liquids, ores, caves and tree generation as well as breaking and placing tiles. The code has been commented for your understanding.

Sprites: https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/terraria/sheet/131821/
EULA: https://erencant347752250.wordpress.com/project-eulas/

===!!=IMPORTANT=!!===
- You must not use this project with the Terraria sprites for commercial use - its ILLEGAL! (but if you do, that's on you, I take no responsiblity for any copyright you may face for adding Terraria's sprites to the project and trying to make money off it! - this is why the sprites aren't included in this project xD)
